The **`<s>`** element is used to highlight no longer pertinent, inaccurate, or wrong text. Browsers render it showing strikethrough text. Its behavior equals the <del> element but is semantically different, <del> is usually used to show document changes.

## Syntax

```html
<s>
  <!-- No longer pertinent, inaccurate, or wrong text here -->
</s>
```

The **`<s>`** element should only contain text content or other elements meant for text content.

## Example

```html
<html>
  <head> </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      <s>worng txet</s>
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
```
