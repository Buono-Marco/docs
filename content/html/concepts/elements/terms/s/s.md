The **`<s>`** element is used to highlight no more pertinent, accurate, or wrong text. Browsers render it showing strikethrough text. Its behavior equals the <del> element but is semantically different. This last is usually used to show document changes.

## Syntax

```html
<s>
  <!-- Text no more pertinent, accurate, or wrong to here -->
</s>
```

The **`<s>`** element should only contain text content or other elements meant for text content.
